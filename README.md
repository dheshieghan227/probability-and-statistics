## 📱 Project 1: Gadget Use & Its Impact on Learning Outcomes

An empirical survey-based research study exploring how undergraduates at the Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) utilize digital tools for their studies.

### Methodology & Insights:
- **Data Collection**: Gathered 67 survey responses from undergraduates using Google Forms.
- **Demographics**: Respondent age ranges from 17 to 24 (Mean: 20.41, Mode/Median: 20).
- **Core Findings**:
  - **92.54%** of respondents find digital gadgets more convenient than traditional pen-and-paper for learning.
  - **Laptops** are the most common primary study device (35.8%), followed closely by tablets (32.8%) and smartphones (31.3%).
  - **Windows** is the most preferred operating system for educational activities.
  - R programming was utilized to clean data, establish frequency distributions, and generate bar and pie charts.

## 💔 Project 2: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Statistical Study

A rigorous statistical analysis performed on a clinical heart disease dataset to investigate correlations between patient demographics, heart rates, blood pressure, and target diagnoses.

### Key Analysis & R Implementation:
The analysis script (`Heart_Disease_Analysis.R`) implements four core statistical paradigms:

1. **Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)**:
   - *Objective*: Check if the mean maximum heart rate is significantly higher in patients with heart disease than in patients without.
   - *Method*: Independent two-sample t-test ($n_1=165$, $n_2=138$).
2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - *Objective*: Investigate if age correlates linearly with resting blood pressure.
   - *Method*: Pearson’s correlation coefficient ($r$) significance testing.
3. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - *Objective*: Model maximum heart rate as a linear function of age.
   - *Method*: Least-squares regression, calculating $R^2$, sum of squared errors, and testing slope significance.
4. **Chi-Square Test of Independence**:
   - *Objective*: Determine if the presence of Coronary Heart Disease is independent of a patient's biological sex.
   - *Method*: Chi-square test on contingency tables.
